## Introduction

Greta Thunberg is a Swedish environmental activist who is known for her
work that addresses the issue of climate change. She has challenged
world leaders to take immediate action against climate change and has
even spoken at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in 2019. Greta
joined the spotlight at the age of 18, and her Twitter account shortly
followed. Today, she has over 4.9 million followers and more than 11.7
thousand tweets that discuss climate change and environmental activism.

With the impending threats of climate change over the past half-decade,
and the prevalence of social media today, we thought it would be
interesting to investigate how social media synchronizes with current
events; more specifically, how the use of social media could affect
responses to climate change. We decided to do an in-depth analysis of
Greta‚Äôs tweets to see if we could find any connections between the word
choice in her tweets to the interactions with the tweet. We determined
how the sentiment of social media posts about climate change influences
engagement, which could lead to more actions being taken to stop climate
change. We have found that Greta Thunberg‚Äôs tweets that have a higher
ratio of emotionally-laden words to total words will receive greater
interaction, measured by the number of retweets.

## Data

your primary data sources‚Äìurl links, citations, AND data descriptions
(some people re-post data that others collect‚Ä¶ be sure to give proper
credit to the workers/org that originally collected the data); your data
cleaning‚Äìdescribe the steps that you took. As much as possible, it
should be replicable via your .Rmd file but not visible in the .pdf
(echo = FALSE)

## Methods

Upon completion of the dataframe `gret_sent`, we decided to use the
ratio variables (i.e.¬†`bingRatio`) as the independent variables in our
study to analyze emotionally-laden words in correlation with retweet
behavior (i.e.¬†`retweet_count`). We did this because we wanted to
measure emotional saturation of a tweet rather than the number of
emotionally-laden words (i.e
`bingWords) within the tweet in order to support the ranging lengths of the tweets. Additionally, we chose to focus on all the emotional words instead of either positive or negative because all dictionary words carry emotional significance, which answers the question of our study.  Next, in order to ensure all dictionaries (Bing, Lough, and NRC) were significantly correlated to the amount of retweets per tweet, we constructed three separate linear regression models along with anova tables. These tables proved to us that all three dictionary ratios had a statistically significant effect of retweet count. However, in order for these tables to portray statistically significant p values for the ratios we used the log value of`retweet_count\`.
In doing so, the graphs produced became more concise and the linear
lines more dramatic. Lastly, we used the following equation to interpret
the three dictionaries‚Äô coefficients, within the anova tables: ln(Yi) =
ùú∑0 + ùú∑1Xi + ui. While the equation originally interprets the
relationship as a correlation between a tweet with zero
emotionally-laden words in comparison to one with 100% emotionally-laden
words, we decided to interpret these results with 10% increases. We did
this in hopes to clarify the results in a real-world sense as there are
rarely tweets that are completely made of emotional words.

## Results

We plotted the linear relationships between the emotional saturation of
tweets and the logarithm of their retweet count. All of the graphs show
a slight positive slope for the linear trend.

When we regressed the logarithm of retweets on the ratio of NRC
dictionary emotional words to total words in the tweet, we found the
coefficient for the ratio of emotional words was statistically
significant, with a coefficient of 1.19. This means that for a 10%
increase in emotional words (an increase of 0.1 in the ratio), there is
an 11.9% increase in retweets.

When we regressed the logarithm of retweets on the ratio of lough
dictionary emotional words to total words in the tweet, we found the
coefficient for the ratio of emotional words was also statistically
significant, with a coefficient of 3.39. This means that for a 10%
increase in emotional words (an increase of 0.1 in the ratio), there is
an 33.9% increase in retweets.

When we regressed the logarithm of retweets on the ratio of bing
dictionary emotional words to total words in the tweet, we found the
coefficient for the ratio of emotional words was also statistically
significant, with a coefficient of 2.97. This means that for a 10%
increase in emotional words (an increase of 0.1 in the ratio), there is
an 29.7% increase in retweets.

Across all three dictionaries, we saw a statistically significant
positive relationship between the ratio of emotional words to total
words in the tweet and the number of retweets the tweet received. While
the coefficients were different, we still have statistically significant
evidence that an increase in the ratio of emotionally laden words is
related to an increase in a tweet‚Äôs retweet count.

measure_dic = data.frame(
  dictionary = c("Bing", "Lough", "Nrc"),
  avgval = c(mean(gret_sent$bingWords), mean(gret_sent$loughWords), mean(gret_sent$nrcWords))
)

## Conclusion

After our analysis, we concluded that Greta Thunberg‚Äôs tweets that have
a higher ratio of emotionally-laden words to total words will receive
greater interaction, measured by the number of retweets. Our main
evidence to support this conclusion is that across all three
dictionaries there is a statistically significant positive relationship
between the word ratio and the logarithm of the retweet count. We can
see all three of the positive linear relationships in Figure 4. In
tables 1, 2, and 3, we can see that the positive coefficients are all
statistically significant.

One limitation of our analysis is that we could not pull all of the
tweets from Thunberg‚Äôs Twitter account. Since we had limited access to
the Twitter API and not research-level access, we could only use around
3,000 of her most recent tweets, which is only a fraction of her
account.

Another limitation is that we cannot be certain that the sentiment
dictionaries include all possible emotional words. This would mean that
some tweets with more emotional words may have been given lower ratios
in our analysis.

Another issue that remains uncertain is that we cannot differentiate
between retweets that come from real humans and retweets that come from
bots. We cannot draw a conclusion that people retweet more emotional
tweets more vs.¬†if bots amplify emotional tweets more. This would be
interesting to explore in a study with more resources or more time
because what tweets bots amplify could have strong real-world impacts.

Another issue that remains uncertain is if the conclusions we drew here
apply to all tweets about climate change, which was our original
research question. Greta Thunberg‚Äôs account was our chosen sample since
she is an important climate change spokesperson, but her account does
not comprise all tweets about climate change. With more time and more
access to the Twitter API, we would be able to investigate the research
question further and see if our results are similar across other
accounts, hashtags, or topics.
